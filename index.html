<hr align="LEFT"> I got a PhD in Physics from the Venezuelan Institute 
for Research (IVIC), with a recognized diploma in Europa. I have 7 years
 of experience among 4 Postdoctoral positions in Europe. As a second 
background, I have complemented my PhD following several courses on 
Sociology (the first three years of this major). I also have a broad 
experience working in computational social science, Big Data and network
 science among several interdisciplinary groups (in mathematics, 
finance, geography, engineering, biology, etc ). Currently, I am 
Visiting Fellow at the Complexity Institute. NTU. Singapore.

My main interest in research is the application of statistical and 
Critical Phenomena approaches to emergent social phenomena. The 
possibility of finding universal patterns, i.e, same qualitative 
behavior in different kind of phenomena. The similarity comes from the 
fact that collective emerging phenomena do not depend on the microscopic
 details of the process. The determinant properties are instead the 
symmetries, dimensionality, and conserved quantities. The theory implied
 on this methodology is the foundation for the field of Critical 
Phenomena, which has proved to be fruitful in allowing for the 
understanding of several patterns of universality.<p>


The use of statistical methods has allowed for major advances in this 
area, by providing a bridge between the microscopic interactions and the
 large collective behavior of the system. My initial research activities
 were focused on agent based models. Making the analogy with social 
systems, is how I could see the emergent phenomena as a consequence of 
well-thought local rules among the interacting particles, which in the 
case of social phenomena are interacting human beings. After several 
works on this direction, I started with data science, as the only way 
for seeking what kind of patterns regarding human behavior is expressed 
by the data.
